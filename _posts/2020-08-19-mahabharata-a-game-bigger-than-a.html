<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In this post, I’m using a particular epoch from the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata and some specific incidents to associate them with game theory concepts.</p>
<p><em><strong>Game theory</strong></em> helps us analyse every minute aspect of an incident through mathematical modelling.</p>
<p>Any interaction is a <em><strong>Game </strong></em>and any person who is set to gain or lose something from that interaction is a <em><strong>Player</strong></em>.</p>
<p> If you search for an example on use of game theory, you will most likely end up with this result where we find out the best “rewards” for two prisoners who are partners in a crime. We decide the outcome based on what will happen if they choose to confess and what will happen if they choose to keep quiet.</p>

<p><strong>Four terms to know</strong> :</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Player: Anyone who participates in the interaction</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Move: An action taken by a player</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Payoff: Final outcome of an event after all the players have acted on their move.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rewards/ Punishment: What the player gains by playing the game</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>International relations have always been an area of interest for game theorists. Many events of historical significance has been researched using bits and pieces of game theory.</p>
<p>Being a newbie to the world of economics, the idea of analyzing an event using economics let alone game theory, is a dangerous one. </p>
<p>The goal here is not to predict the outcome of the Mahabharata story because it has already been recorded, <em><strong>but to present it from a different context.</strong></em></p>
<p>The first section “Setting the scene” is about explaining the situation I’m using to build a game and introduce the players. Hasthinapur is a kingdom ruled by the heirs of Kuru. King Shantanu sets in motion a sequence of events leading to the Kurukshetra/Mahabharata War that destroys most of Kuru clan and its neighbors thus initiating the Kali Yuga (final yuga for mankind) .</p>
<p>Each section of this article, introduces a concept from economics and it’s extended areas and correlates it with events from the epic before the war.</p>
<p><em><strong>PS</strong>: If you’re not familiar with the Mahabharata, a quick search will help you understand this article completely.</em></p>
<h3>Setting the Scene: Udyoga Parva</h3>
<p>The sons of Pandu (erstwhile ruler of Hasthinapur) and their wife Draupadi have returned from their 13 year exile .</p>
<p>The exile was the only way of repaying their debt to Duryodhana, the son of Dhridhirashtra (the current ruler) with whom Yudhistra (officially eldest son of Pandu) had played a game of dice that cost him his land, made his brothers and his wife slaves of Duryodhana.</p>
<p>&nbsp; It has been 13 years and nobody knows if Duryodhana will let Yudhishtra rule Hasthinapur, let alone half of it. In order to induce the Kauravas into peace, an envoy needs to be sent to Duryodhana demanding half the kingdom. At the same time a message should be sent to all kings of the earth who favor Yudhisthira's cause to be prepared for war if Duryodhana does not oblige.</p>
<h3>Diplomacy : An effort for peace</h3>
<h5>Informal Mediator</h5>
<p>Thus we are in the episode when Pandavas begin their preparations for a negotiation with their cousin Duryodhana.</p>
<p>The royal court advisor Vidura ( Dhridhirashtra’s half brother) in his personal capacity requests the Pandavas to negotiate for their land before declaring war.</p>
<p>He did not contact the Pandavas as an official from Hasthinapur, therefore the discussion is considered informal. </p>
<p>By definition, a mediator does not take sides, he/she helps both parties involved in a dispute to arrive at a solution that benefits both sides.</p>
<p>In this case, Vidura in his heart wants for the Pandavas to be Kuru’s heir and war is the only to get it done, but he keeps his personal interests at bay and hopes to avoid the blood bath knowing very well that it will destroy everyone.</p>
<h5>Official Mediator</h5>
<p>Obliging to Vidura’s request, Krishna, as the ‘representative’ of the Pandavas goes to the court of Hasthinapur to negotiate.</p>
<h3>Bargaining Game</h3>
<p> A <strong>sequential-move bargaining game</strong> begins when the first player, the “proposer” who proposes a solution in fixed financial quantity. This proposed quantity represents a take-it-or-leave-it offer. The second player, the “responder,” may accept or reject the offer. </p>
<p>In this situation,</p>
<p><em><strong>Proposer</strong></em> — Krishna in lieu of the Pandavas</p>
<p><em><strong>Responder</strong> </em>— Duryodhana in lieu of Hasthinapur</p>
<p>Krishna becomes Pandavas ambassador and goes to royal court of Hasthinapur to discuss..</p>
<p>He asks for their kingdom to be returned, they refuse !</p>
<p>He asks for at least 5 villages, they refuse !</p>
<p>He asks for an apology, they refuse !</p>
<p>Duryodhana attempts to arrest Krishna, Pandavas call for war !</p>
<p>The personality theory in bargaining emphasizes that the type of personality of players involved in the negotiation determines the bargaining process and its outcome. </p>
<p>Here Duryodana’s ego refuses any compensation. As a responder he rejects the bargain even though rejecting will get him a poorer payoff. He cares not only about what he gets but also the rewards/payoffs of the proposer (Pandavas) as well. His personal goals decided the outcome of the negotiation.</p>
<p><em><strong>PS</strong>: The decision to wage war is completely driven by the emotional side of a person. Game theory assumes that the players are rational and will choose the move whose outcome will give them maximum payoff/reward.</em></p>
<p>If Duryodhana had agreed to return the land it won (through the game of dice) back to the Pandavas, it is only loss of kingdom and power. But instead, his ego gets the better of him once again and he desires to completely destroy the Pandavas. As the story goes, entire clan of Kuru goes down with the war.</p>
<h3>Reasons for this war:</h3>
<p>The Kuru clan did not fight with each other just for their kingdom. It involved deep-seated hatred among cousins, justice for the woman who was disrobed in the royal court and if nothing else, for <em>Dharma </em>to get established. A simple , static game cannot suffice as a model in this situation.</p>
<h3>Dynamic Elements of the “Game”</h3>
<p>The battle of Kurukshetra ( land where the clan of Kuru fought) saw rulers, fathers, brothers and friends fight with each other — some to avenge the wrongs they suffered, some to protect humanity, some to undo their mistakes and some to let go of their guilt.</p>
<p>These <strong>emotional payoffs</strong> influenced by behavior, incentives, beliefs and consequences will need more than just some basic analysis I’m making now.</p>
<p>(<strong>Will leave it for Part 2</strong>)</p>

<h3>‘Superplayers’</h3>
<p>Krishna and Shakuni can be considered the ‘superplayer(s)’ of this game. i.e. <em><strong>player who plays other players</strong></em>, in the sense that all the events leading to the war were operated by them . It was Krishna who constantly adviced Pandavas on what to do next and Shakuni who extracts his revenge on the Kuru clan by manipulating Duryodhana. (Read<a href="https://threedotsinarow.substack.com/p/shakuni.html"> Shakuni</a>)</p>
<h3>Hypothetical Outcome: What could have happened?</h3>
<p>Assuming that Duryodhana had agreed to return their land back after Pandavas exile, the story would have not just ended there.</p>
<p>Krishna had by then convinced Pandavas that their duty on earth was to establish <em>Dharma </em>for <em>Kali Yuga. </em>Dhridhirashtra was the rightful ruler of Hasthinapur.</p>
<p> In an alternate story line, after Pandavas reestablish Indraprastha, they can decide wage war against Hasthinapur but with actual power and higher chances of winning. </p>
<p>Thus by refusing negotiation the 1st time, Duryodhana has given Hasthinapur the upper hand. </p>
